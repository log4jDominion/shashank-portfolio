          Developed a search engine for the U.S. National Archives (NARA) to enhance retrieval of partially digitized and physical records. Leveraged Graph Neural Networks and ColBERT to link physical records with digital representations. Integrated OCR outputs and archival metadata for improved searchability and implemented a Late Interaction ranking mechanism for better query relevance. This work enhances access to archival collections by bridging the gap between digital and physical records.

          - Official submission to NTCIR-18 SUSHI (Searching Unseen Sources for Historical Information) shared task for searching for archival materials and analyzing them organized by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
